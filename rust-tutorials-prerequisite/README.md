# Rust Programming Tutorials 

To help me understand the syntax of the language Solana's smart contracts are written in, I chose to work on a Rust mini-course, which consists of a three hour video explaning the language basics. Every keystroke of code was typed by me, no copy and paste, and no LLM use either.
