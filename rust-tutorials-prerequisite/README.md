# Rust Programming Tutorials 

To help me understand the syntax of the language Solana's smart contracts are written in, I chose to complete a Rust mini-course, which consists of a three hour video explaning the language basics, with 15 chapters. Every keystroke of code was typed by me, no copy and paste, and no LLM use either.

## Chapters

0. Chapter 0 Introduction to Rust- Start with the basics of Rust, its syntax, and why it's a game-changer in systems programming.

1. Chapter 1 Primitive Data Types- Understand the basic data types that Rust uses to handle numbers, booleans, and characters.

2. Chapter 2 Compound Data Types - Explore complex data structures such as tuples and arrays that store multiple values.

3. Chapter 3 Functions - Learn how to define and use functions, understanding Rust's approach to code organization and reuse.

4. Chapter 4 Ownership - Dive into Rust's unique memory management model that ensures safety without a garbage collector through ownership.

5. Chapter 5 Borrowing, and References - Rust's memory management model that ensures safety without a garbage collector via creating references via borrowing.

6. Chapter 6 Variables and Mutability - Discuss how Rust handles variable mutability and how you can control it.

7. Chapter 7 Constants - Which are immutable by default and never can become mutable, control you variables through creatin safe constants

8. Chapter 8 Shadowing - Contrast the use of constants with variables and explore how shadowing enhances flexibility in variable handling.

9. Chapter 9 Comments - The art of writing useful comments and documentation to make your code more understandable.

10. Chapter 10 Introduction to Control Flow - Learn the basics of using if-else statements to make decisions in your code. Understand how these conditional statements evaluate expressions and execute different code branches based on boolean conditions.

11. Chapter 11 Looping Mechanisms - Explore the three primary types of loops in Rust—loop, while, and for. Each serves a specific purpose, from executing indefinitely until a condition is met, to iterating over collections or ranges efficiently.

12. Chapter 12 Defining Structs - Learn how to define structs in Rust, which are custom data types that allow you to compose a collection of multiple fields into a single cohesive unit. Understand the role of immutability and how it impacts the struct's data.

13. Chapter 13 Introduction to Enums - Discover enums in Rust, which allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Learn how enums can be used to handle different types of related data in a type-safe way.

14. Chapter 14 Error Handling Techniques - Understand Rust’s approach to anticipatory error handling with Result and Option types.

15. Chapter 15  Collection Types - Finish with advanced topics like managing groups of data with 
    1. vectors
    2. UTF-8 strings
    3. and hash maps
