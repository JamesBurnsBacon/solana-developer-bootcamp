#Rust Programming Tutorials 

To help me understand the syntax of the language Solana's smart contracts are written in, I chose to complete a Rust mini-course, which consists of a three hour video explaning the language basics, with 15 chapters. Every keystroke of code was typed by me, no copy and paste, and no LLM use either.

Chapter 0 Introduction to Rust 00:00
Chapter 0 Install Rust 08:05
Chapter 0 Write first Rust program 09:26
Chapter 0 Cargo package manager 12:36
Start with the basics of Rust, its syntax, and why it's a game-changer in systems programming.

Chapter 1 Primitive Data Types 15:53
Understand the basic data types that Rust uses to handle numbers, booleans, and characters.

Chapter 2 Compound Data Types 25:12
Explore complex data structures such as tuples and arrays that store multiple values.

Chapter 3 Functions 46:40
Learn how to define and use functions, understanding Rust's approach to code organization and reuse.

Chapter 4 Ownership 01:06:27
Dive into Rust's unique memory management model that ensures safety without a garbage collector through ownership.

Chapter 5 Borrowing, and References 01:15:22
Dive into Rust's memory management model that ensures safety without a garbage collector via creating references via borrowing.

Chapter 6 Variables and Mutability 01:27:16
Discuss how Rust handles variable mutability and how you can control it.

Chapter 7 Constants 01:31:05
Which are immutable by default and never can become mutable, control you variables through creatin safe constants

Chapter 8 Shadowing 01:38:00
Contrast the use of constants with variables and explore how shadowing enhances flexibility in variable handling.

Chapter 9 Comments 01:46:49
Master the art of writing useful comments and documentation to make your code more understandable.

Chapter 10 Introduction to Control Flow 01:49:33
Learn the basics of using if-else statements to make decisions in your code. Understand how these conditional statements evaluate expressions and execute different code branches based on boolean conditions.

Chapter 11 Looping Mechanisms 01:58:29
Explore the three primary types of loops in Rust—loop, while, and for. Each serves a specific purpose, from executing indefinitely until a condition is met, to iterating over collections or ranges efficiently.

Chapter 12 Defining Structs 02:09:25
Learn how to define structs in Rust, which are custom data types that allow you to compose a collection of multiple fields into a single cohesive unit. Understand the role of immutability and how it impacts the struct's data.

Chapter 13 Introduction to Enums 02:21:13
Discover enums in Rust, which allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Learn how enums can be used to handle different types of related data in a type-safe way.

Chapter 14 Error Handling Techniques 02:33:07
Understand Rust’s approach to anticipatory error handling with Result and Option types.

Chapter 15  Collection Types 02:41:25
Finish with advanced topics like managing groups of data with 
a) vectors 02:42:10
b) UTF-8 strings, 02:53:20
c) and hash maps 03:01:32
for efficient data retrieval.
